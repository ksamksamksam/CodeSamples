CODE SAMPLE


DESCRIPTION

This code sample is a small section from a Unity project which is a game environment testing different agent-based crowd behaviors. The code presented defines the behaviors that determine each agent’s movements in the game and updates the agent’s torque and force over time based on a calculated desired velocity. 

It is written in C# using the Unity scripting API. The code is from 2010 so aspects of the API may be different than what it is now.
